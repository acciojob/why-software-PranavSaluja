	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I want to become a developer because I enjoy the process of building things that solve real problems. There's a deep satisfaction in taking an idea and turning it into something functional, interactive, and impactful through code. Development combines logic, creativity, and constant learning â€” and that excites me.</p>
